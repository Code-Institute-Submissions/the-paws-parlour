The Paws Parlour

My aim is to create a user friendly website for a dog grooming business; The Paws Parlour. The aim would be to provide information about 
the business, it's location, a gauge of prices and examples of previous work. As a business they are keen to get more customers so by 
having it simple and user friendly with ease of access to contact information is important.

I would want to focus the user experience for mobile first and change as needed for desktop viewing. 

There will be four pages to the website; 

 - I aim to have a landing page with some basic information on the business and about the owners as well as the company logo. 
Scrolling down will be customer reviews. 

 - There will be a gallery page displaying the photos of the dogs which i want to enlarge as you scroll over them.

 - I want to add a contact page with the address/email/phone number as well as a simple form whereby someone could get in touch with them -
  with the option to add a photo of their dog for more information.

I would like a price list also to be included in a .doc or .pdf file which can be downloaded and printed for future reference -
 like with the CV in the resume project.


The header bar with the page tabs will be visable with the company logo throughout, with the menu condensed from 4 columns to two by two
 on smaller screens.
In the footer bar i would like a link to their facebook page and any other social media accounts they may have. 


Features - 

contact form - write a simple form to send off with a photo of their dog if they are unsure of what is needed or to get price/timeframe 
from owners. This would be beneficial to both the client and the groomers - the groomers can give a realistic time and price if aware of 
problem areas/the condition of the coat. 

Address/email address and contact details - ensuring potential customers can get in touch with the owners using different mediums. 

Price list and treatments - providing a list of treatment options price ranges (prices may differ depending on the dog size but the 
state of the coat for example) - having this in a downloadable format will be useful to ensure people come back  - can print and put on 
fridge for ease of use. 

I want to add links to their facebook page also where they often add in photos of dogs being groomed - updates on trading hours etc. 

I want to add a photo gallery page so potential clients can view a various amount of dog styles/see the cuts etc and the environment in which
 the dogs are being groomed. This is very important and i need to ensure that the picture files are not too big which could cause problems
  with loading the page. 

Having customer reviews on the landing page is beneficial to encourage people to read more into the company or get in touch with the owners.

I used bootstrap frameworks for the layout as well as the form on the contact page with styled buttons. 

With regards to the hover and zoom feature on the gallery I used a website called W3schools.

The photos and information about the company are from my family who's business this is. The plan would be when I am a lot more 
knowledgeable to create a webiste for her business. 

Things to consider for future;

It may be beneficial to if we were to add more reviews on to have them on a carousel so it is not too overwhelming. I think the same would 
be beneficial for the galery  -with subsections for style of coat - ie curly/long/short. 

The project is saved within my Github repository and can be viewed there. I have added in with the file a very basic Balsamiq I put together
before starting the project so I had an idea of what I wanted to include and the kind of layout I wanted.
